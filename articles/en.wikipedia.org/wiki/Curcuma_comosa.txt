Curcuma comosa

Curcuma comosa is a species of flowering plant in the ginger family
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zingiberaceae]. It is native to much of Asia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia], including Thailand
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand], Indonesia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia], and Malaysia
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia].[1]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-qu-1] The herb is
cultivated in Thailand, especially in the Northern Province, including
Petchaboon [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petchaboon], and the Northeastern
Province, including Loei [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loei]. Curcuma comosa is
widely used as a traditional herbal remedy
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbalism].

Uses[edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Curcuma_comosa&action=edit
&section=1]]

This medicinal plant is used for its anti-inflammatory
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory] properties in the treatment of
postpartum uterine bleeding
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_hemorrhage] and uterine
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus] inflammation
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation]. Research suggests that Curcuma
comosa extract possesses a strong anti-inflammatory activity and has a potential
to be developed as a therapeutic compound for diverse neurological disorders
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology] associated with inflammation.[citation
needed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]] Thai
traditional practitioners use the rhizome
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome] of C. comosa in the treatment of women
for the alleviation of postpartum uterine pain, the enhancement of uterine
involution [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone] and the reduction of
uterine inflammation after delivery
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth].[2]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-2] Numerous studies have
been conducted on the effects of C. comosa showing that it can reduce blood
cholesterol [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lipids],[3]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-suks-3] increase the
thickness of epithelial cells lining the vagina
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina],[4]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-piya-4] and decrease
uterine smooth muscle contraction.[5]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-sawa-5] The plant is
also used to repair vaginal wall prolapse
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolapse], tighten vaginal muscles, and relieve
premenstrual syndrome [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premenstrual_syndrome] and
cramping [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea].[citation needed
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]] It has been used for
centuries in Thailand as a remedy for many other gynecological
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynecology] problems including vaginal dryness
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_dryness], hot flashes
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_flashes], excessive white and yellow vaginal
discharge [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_discharge], bad odor, and
irregular, excessive, or absent menstrual cycles
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menstrual_cycle].[citation needed
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]] It appears to
increase the effect of ovarian [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovary] and
testicular [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle] hormones
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone], and may have an estrogenic
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen] effect.[citation needed
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed]] It is used in Thai
luxury spas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spa] to lift sagging muscles, promote
circulation, and provide good health and glowing skin.[citation needed

Research[edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Curcuma_comosa&action=
edit&section=2]]

Studies in Thailand researched the effects of crude extract from the root of
Curcuma comosa on the uterus of the rat [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat] as
compared to female estradiol [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol] hormone.
Results reported included an increase in the thickness of the uterus epithelial
cells lining the vagina and improved growth and induction of keratin
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin] synthesis in the mucous membrane
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucous_membrane] of the vagina. However,
estrogenic activities of Curcuma comosa were milder than those of estradiol.[4]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-piya-4]

Methanolic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol] extract of rhizome of C.
comosa has been proven to kill the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans]. The extract was purified
to its active ingredients and it was found that some diphenylheptanoid
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarylheptanoid] compounds, such as
1,7-diphenyl-3-acetoxy-hept-trans-6-ene, can inhibit the motility
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motility] of the roundworm.[6]
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-jurg-6]

Butanolic [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butanolic] and ethyl acetate
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethyl_acetate] extract of rhizome of C. comosa
had a stimulative effect on bile [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile] secretion
and a decrease in blood cholesterol was reported. Separation of the active
ingredients from diarylheptanoids
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarylheptanoid] and phloracetophenone glucoside 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phloracetophenone_glucoside&action=e
dit&redlink=1] compounds were carried out and some active compounds, such as
1,7-diphenyl-5-hydroxy-(1E)-1-heptene and 4,6-dihydroxy-2-o-(b-D-glucopyranosyl)
acetophenone, were found to have a stimulative effect on bile secretion in
rats.[3] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-suks-3]

A 95% ethanol extract of C. comosa decreased uterine smooth muscle contraction
in rats.[5] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curcuma_comosa#cite_note-sawa-5]

An ethyl acetate extract of the rhizome was orally administered to male sheep
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep] and hamsters
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster] and a decrease in cholesterol and
triglyceride were reported.[7]
